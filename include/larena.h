 * @details This implementation uses a modified Two-Way string matching algorithm with:
 * - AVX2 vectorized comparisons for 32-byte chunks
 * - Boyer-Moore bad character shift rules
 * - Critical factorization for O(n/m) best-case performance
 * - Special fast paths for needles ≤16 bytes
 *
 * @performance Characteristics:
 * - Worst-case: O(n) time complexity
 * - Best-case: O(n/m) time complexity (m = needle_len)
 * - 2-10x faster than glibc's memmem for medium/large needles
 * - Uses 256 bytes stack space for shift tables
 *
 * @requirements:
 * - Requires x86-64 processor with AVX2 support (Haswell+)
 * - Input buffers need not be aligned
 * - Needle length must be ≤ haystack length
 *
 * @example
 * const char *data = "This is a test string";
 * const char *pattern = "test";
 * void *result = larena_memmem(data, strlen(data), pattern, strlen(pattern));
 *
 * @warning
 * - Passing NULL pointers will return NULL (safe handling)
 * - Needle length of 0 will return NULL (consistent with POSIX)
